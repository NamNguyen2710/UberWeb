              <h1>How Uber works</h1>
              <p>On-demand transportation technology is our core service, and the app that connects driver-partners and riders is what makes it all possible. Here's how it works, step by step:</p>
            </div>
            <div className="col">
              <div className="paragraph">
                <h3>Step 1: A rider opens the app</h3>
                <p>The rider enters their destination into the “Where to?” box; reviews each ride option for vehicle size, price, and estimated dropoff time; chooses the desired option; then confirms the pickup.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="paragraph">
                <h3>Step 2: The rider is matched with a driver</h3>
                <p>A nearby driver sees and chooses to accept the rider’s ride request. The rider is automatically notified when the driver’s vehicle is about a minute away.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="paragraph">
                <h3>Step 3: The driver picks up the rider</h3>
                <p>The driver and the rider verify each other’s names and the destination. Then the driver starts the ride.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="paragraph">
                <h3>Step 4: The driver takes the rider to the destination</h3>
                <p>The app gives the driver the option to access turn-by-turn directions.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="paragraph">
                <h3>Step 5: The driver and rider leave ratings and reviews</h3>
                <p>At the end of each trip, drivers and riders can rate each other from 1 to 5 stars. Riders also have the option to give the driver compliments and a tip directly in the app.</p>
